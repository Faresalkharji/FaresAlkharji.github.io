                 <div>OUR STORY
Like our products, our roots are simple. Our story begins with three friends, who loved to travel and explore the world, bonded over a shared belief that fundamental nutrition is the cornerstone of health and wellness. A vibrant, healthy lifestyle begins with real, nutrient-rich food.
These friends soon came to the realization that access to quality nutrition is often limited. How could others enjoy the benefits of wholesome ingredients in a world of overly processed foods? The answer was obvious. Pave the way for plant-forward living by making real, healthy food accessible to everyone. This would be our ongoing mission.
Pressed began in 2010. Our company started small — really small. Our first location was a 25 square-foot “juice closet” in Los Angeles. Soon we included a food truck in Malibu. But it wasn’t long before our vitamin-rich blends caught on and our mission gained momentum.
Today, Pressed continues to grow with stores throughout the US along with online and wholesale distribution. You may also notice that our name has evolved from “Pressed Juic- ery” to simply “Pressed.” That’s because we are also evolving. Now in addition to our signa- ture cold-pressed juices, we offer an array of wholesome plant-based foods to keep you nourished throughout the day. It’s all part of our ongoing mission to make plant-forward living as convenient and delicious as possible.</div>
